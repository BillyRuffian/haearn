## Instructions for AI Agents

1. **Read this file first** at the start of every session
2. **Read `docs/PLAN.md`** to understand the implementation roadmap and current progress
3. **Keep `docs/PLAN.md` up to date** — this is critical:
   - Check off completed items (`- [x]`) immediately after implementing them
   - Add new items when the user requests features not yet in the plan
   - Move or re-prioritize items when the user changes direction
   - Update the "Last Updated" date at the top when making changes
4. **Update this file (AGENTS.md)** when:
   - The user makes a design decision that affects future work
   - New patterns or conventions are established
   - Technical choices are made that should be remembered
5. **Ask clarifying questions** before implementing if requirements are unclear

## Project Overview

Haearn is a **hardcore weightlifting tracking application** built with Ruby on Rails 8. It's designed for serious lifters who need granular control over their workout data, including tracking specific machines, cable pulley ratios, and detailed progress metrics.

## Critical Commands

```bash
# Start development server (REQUIRED - uses foreman for CSS compilation)
bin/dev

# DO NOT USE rails server directly - CSS won't compile
# ❌ rails server
# ❌ rails s
```

## Tech Stack

- **Ruby on Rails 8** (latest)
- **SQLite** for development (Rails 8 default)
- **Rails 8 Authentication** - NOT Devise (use `rails generate authentication`)
- **Hotwire** (Turbo + Stimulus) - make it feel like a native app
- **Bootstrap 5** - with heavy custom dark/moody styling
- **PWA** - runs from phone home screen, offline support via Service Worker
- **Importmaps** - no Node.js bundling for JS

## Design Philosophy

### Visual Theme: Dark & Moody Iron
- Dark backgrounds (#1a1a1a, #121212)
- Iron/steel accent colors (gunmetal grays, rust oranges) and gradients
- Industrial typography
- Minimal, functional UI - no fluff
- Mobile-first design

### UX Philosophy
- **Fast**: Turbo Frames/Streams everywhere, minimal full page loads
- **Efficient**: Fewest taps possible to log a set
- **Informative**: Always show last workout's numbers
- **Offline-capable**: Service worker caches app shell, syncs when online

### JavaScript Philosophy
- **Always use Stimulus controllers** for client-side behavior
- Never write inline JavaScript or standalone JS files
- Stimulus controllers live in `app/javascript/controllers/`
- Use data attributes to connect HTML to controllers

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Weight Normalization**: All weights stored in kg internally. Convert to/from user's preferred unit on display/input.

2. **Blocks for Everything**: Even single exercises are a block with one exercise. This unifies the model for normal sets, supersets, and circuits.

3. **Superset Pattern**: Block A might have [Bench Press, Bent Row]. User does: A1 set 1, A2 set 1, A1 set 2, A2 set 2, etc.

4. **Machine-Specific Tracking**: Same exercise on different machines is tracked separately. PRs are per exercise AND per machine.

5. **Three Notes Levels**:
   - `Workout.notes` - "Cold day, felt stiff"
   - `WorkoutExercise.session_notes` - "Shoulder twinge on set 3"
   - `WorkoutExercise.persistent_notes` - "Use handle B, seat at 4"

6. **PR Scope Includes Equipment State**: PRs can be tracked separately as raw vs equipped, where "equipped" means any set using belt, knee sleeves, wrist wraps, or straps.

7. **Performance Notifications Pattern**: Analytics alerts are persisted in `notifications` and surfaced dynamically via JSON polling (`/notifications/feed`) with Stimulus (`notifications_center_controller`) in navbar + dashboard. Rest timer completion should also persist to this same notification feed (`/notifications/rest_timer_expired`) so browser push and in-app notifications stay consistent. Alert generation/display must honor user notification preferences from Settings.
   Keep the active-workout rest timer runtime mounted at the layout level while an active workout exists so timers survive navigation and expired timers can still complete on reconnect.
   When a live page handles a rest-timer completion itself, persist the notification with push suppressed to avoid duplicate local-notification + web-push alerts on the same device.
   On phone widths, navbar notification dropdowns should use viewport-safe positioning rather than container-relative sizing/alignment so the panel cannot render off-screen on iPhone.

8. **Dashboard Information Architecture**: Keep `dashboard#index` focused on overview/quick actions and place charts in `dashboard#analytics` (accessible from desktop nav and mobile bottom nav).

9. **Analytics Query Pattern**: For week-based dashboard analytics, use grouped SQL week buckets (SQLite `strftime`) plus Ruby gap-filling instead of issuing one query per week; preload lookup tables (exercise/machine) before loops to avoid N+1.

10. **Analytics/Admin Index Baseline**: Maintain indexes for time-window analytics and admin counters (`workouts(user_id, finished_at)`, `users.created_at`, `users.updated_at`, `workouts.created_at`) before adding new chart/counter queries.

11. **Dashboard Analytics Caching**: Expensive dashboard analytics datasets should use user-scoped short-TTL `Rails.cache` entries; keep active workout and readiness checks uncached for near-real-time feedback.
    Invalidate dashboard analytics cache after commits that affect analytics inputs (`Workout`, `WorkoutExercise`, `ExerciseSet`) using `DashboardAnalyticsCache.invalidate_for_user!`.
    Cache invalidation is deduped per request/context via `Current` tracking to avoid repeated version bumps during bulk set/exercise updates.
    Cache keys are chart-scoped and include per-user per-chart version tokens (`...:version:n`) so invalidation can target only affected charts without broad deletes.
    Prefer scoped invalidation keys per model/change type so non-impacting updates (e.g., notes-only edits) do not clear unrelated analytics caches.
    Keep dashboard page assembly in service objects so `DashboardController` stays focused on routing/rendering while chart calculations migrate out incrementally.
    Keep chart/query calculations in dedicated analytics service objects (for example `DashboardAnalyticsCalculator`) instead of adding new calculation methods back into the controller.

12. **Mobile Calendar Density Rule**: On small screens, calendar cells should prioritize glanceability by showing activity color intensity + workout-count badge only; hide per-day volume/set text and workout-dot clusters.

13. **Performance Alert Guardrails**: Volume-drop alerts should compare week-to-date volume against the same elapsed portion of last week and should not fire before any workout is logged in the current week. Fatigue analysis baselines must stay scoped to the exact exercise + machine combination.

14. **Calendar Activity Tiering**: Calendar activity coloring should use explicit tiers by workout count (1/2/3/4+) with progressively stronger cell backgrounds and badge contrast, optimized for quick mobile glanceability.

15. **Web Push Delivery Pipeline**: Browser push uses persisted `PushSubscription` records per user and VAPID configuration (`VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`, `VAPID_SUBJECT` or `credentials.web_push.*`). Deliver pushes from persisted `Notification` records via `WebPushNotificationService`, and auto-prune expired/invalid subscriptions on push errors.

16. **Analytics Cache Observability**: Dashboard analytics cache must emit per-user daily counters (`cache_hit`, `cache_miss`, `invalidation`) and `ActiveSupport::Notifications` events (`dashboard_analytics_cache.fetch`, `dashboard_analytics_cache.invalidate`) so hit-rate regressions are visible.

17. **Web Push Observability**: Push delivery telemetry should be tracked in `WebPushNotificationService` as counters for attempts/successes/failures, bucketed by endpoint host and failure error class, with simple query/reset helpers for operational checks and tests.

18. **Web Push Retry Policy**: Retry only transient push failures (timeouts/network interruptions, 429, 5xx/push-service errors) with exponential backoff; do not retry permanent subscription errors (`ExpiredSubscription`/`InvalidSubscription`) and continue pruning invalid subscriptions.

19. **Push Subscription Health**: Track per-device delivery health on `PushSubscription.last_successful_push_at`; surface user-facing health indicators as subscribed device count + most recent successful push timestamp.

20. **Offline Confidence UX**: Keep a persistent, glanceable sync-confidence widget driven by `offline_controller` showing state (`Offline`/`Syncing`/`Sync failed`/`Synced`), queued action count, last synced time, and a manual retry trigger.
    The navbar sync-confidence widget should render a dedicated retry/sync control in the DOM so browser regressions can assert queued/error recovery states directly.

21. **Quick Log Mode**: Active workout pages can switch into a one-thumb Quick Log mode (query-param driven) that prioritizes primary set inputs and single-tap logging, while preserving full mode for RPE/RIR/warmup details.

22. **Machine Setup Memory**: Store personal setup defaults on `Machine` (`seat_setting`, `pin_setting`, `handle_setting`) and surface the combined setup summary in workout logging context.

23. **Plate Sanity Warnings**: Plate calculator should display inline warnings for impossible/impractical targets (below bar weight, uneven side loading, excessive plate count per side, non-exact combinations) instead of silently failing.

24. **Machine Unit Default & Input Rule**: New machines should default `display_unit` to the creating user's `preferred_unit`. For set entry, when a machine has `display_unit`, UI labels/placeholders/input hints must use that machine unit; otherwise use user preferred unit.

25. **Regression Testing Direction**: For new regression coverage, prefer RSpec over Minitest. Keep high-risk UI behavior checks in focused request/helper specs (with fixture-backed deterministic setup), and extend this suite whenever regressions are fixed.
    For browser-backed Stimulus regressions, prefer a small Capybara system-spec layer only for the highest-risk interactive flows, and guard JS-only specs so restricted environments can skip cleanly when browser/socket support is unavailable.
    For browser-backed system specs, prefer isolated `users(:system)` fixture data plus committed session-cookie sign-in so Selenium sees deterministic records without leaking active-workout state into request/service specs.
    In CI, only run JS system specs from an explicit browser-focused job (`RUN_JS_SYSTEM_SPECS=1`); keep the default test job on request/helper/model coverage so headless environment drift does not fail the main suite.

26. **Core Safety Net Baseline**: Keep a small RSpec request-suite that always covers core user flows (auth gating, workout lifecycle, settings updates), push endpoints (subscription + rest-timer dedupe), and admin audit-log access/filtering to catch high-impact regressions early.

27. **Progression Messaging Timing**: Do not show progression prompts during active set entry. Aggregate and show progression updates together on completed workout pages so logging flow stays uncluttered.

28. **Set Form Prefill Rules**: New set forms should prefill by strict order: (a) if current workout has prior sets for the exercise+machine, copy the immediately previous set; (b) otherwise copy set 1 from the previous finished session for that exact exercise+machine; (c) if no history exists, leave fields blank/default.
    The visible "Last" workout summary and any "last weight/reps" helper logic must use the most recent completed matching exercise+machine session and completion/position ordering within that session, not raw `created_at`.
    The workout "Last" button should mirror the previous-session set payload too, including warmup/AMRAP and other extended set flags, not just weight/reps.
    Keep add-set and edit-set UIs built from shared exercise-set field partials so advanced set inputs stay aligned across both flows.
    Duplicate-set rest-timer restarts must carry the same block-specific rest duration metadata as normal set submissions.

29. **Rest Timer Defaults & Block Wiring**: The rest timer should bootstrap from the user's configured `default_rest_seconds` unless a block-specific rest override is present. Per-block rest controls must be rendered in workout blocks via `block-rest` so both set submissions and duplicate-set actions can propagate block rest seconds reliably. When workout logging creates a brand new `WorkoutBlock`, rely on `WorkoutBlock` model defaults instead of hardcoding `rest_seconds` in controllers.
30. **Alphabetical Picker Rule**: When controllers fetch exercise or equipment collections for UI selection, admin review, or user-facing export lists, default to alphabetical ordering through the model `ordered` scopes. If a flow needs a "recent" subset, choose the subset by recency but present that subset alphabetically.
31. **Exercise Seed Naming Rule**: Global seeded exercises should name the movement, not the equipment, whenever the app already models equipment separately. Keep true movement differences like incline/decline/close-grip, but merge deprecated equipment-prefixed seed aliases into the canonical movement exercise on reseed.
32. **Workout Show Contracts**: Completed workout pages should not render add-exercise entry points. Active workout blocks must render `block-rest` controls inside each `.workout-block`, the workout page must keep the rest-timer stage-panel markup (`rest-timer-stage`, `rest-timer-panel`) present for smooth transitions, and completed workouts should surface grouped progression updates instead of in-form prompts.
33. **SQLite Test Harness Rule**: For Minitest in this app, default SQLite-backed test runs to single-process mode and honor `PARALLEL_WORKERS=1` as a real “do not parallelize” setting in `test/test_helper.rb`; otherwise the suite is prone to `SQLite3::BusyException: database is locked`.

// app/javascript/controllers/rest_timer_controller.js
import { Controller } from "@hotwired/stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
  // Timer logic:
  // - Default countdown (configurable per exercise, e.g., 90s)
  // - Skip button to dismiss immediately
  // - +15s / -15s buttons to adjust on the fly
  // - Auto-starts after logging a set
  // - Audio/vibration alert when complete
}
```
